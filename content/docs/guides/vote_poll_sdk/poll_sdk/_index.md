# How to Use the Waku Connect Poll SDK

To demonstrate how to use the Waku Connect Poll SDK in your dApp, we will create a TypeScript React app from scratch.

You can then adapt the steps depending on your dApp configuration and build setup.

The resulting code of this guide can be found at
https://github.com/status-im/wakuconnect-vote-poll-sdk/tree/main/examples/mainnet-poll.

Here is a preview of the end result:
