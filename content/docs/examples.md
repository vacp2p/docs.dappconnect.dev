## JS-Waku Examples Repository

We maintain a number of examples in the [waku-org/js-waku-examples](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku-examples#readme) repository.

These examples use the latest published version of js-waku.

Any example from the repository can be bootstrapped by helper package `@waku/app`. More details here: [README.md](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku-examples/tree/master/create-waku-app)
