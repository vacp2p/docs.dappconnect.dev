# DappConnect Docs

DappConnect is a suite of libraries, SDKs and documentations to help you use Waku in your dApp.

Waku is decentralized, censorship-resistant, network and protocol family.
It enables you to add communication features to your dApp in a decentralized manner,
ensuring your users that they will not be censored or deplatformed.

Waku can be used for chat purposes and for many machine-to-machine use cases.
You can learn more about Waku at [waku.vac.dev](https://waku.vac.dev).

The [get started](./overview) documentation introduces the js-waku library and the main API you would need to start building.
JS-Waku is the TypeScript implementation of the Waku protocol,
built for browser environment.

The [guides](./guides) describe specific usages of js-waku in more details.

The js-waku repository also holds a number of [examples](./examples.md).
The examples are working proof-of-concepts that demonstrate several features of Waku.
Check out the [example list](./examples.md) to see what feature each example demonstrates. 

Finally, if you want to learn how Waku works under the hoods, check the specs at [rfc.vac.dev](https://rfc.vac.dev/).
